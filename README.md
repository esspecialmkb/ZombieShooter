Working Code-Base Dev for ZombieDungeon and DoomVox

mapDevAppState is a proof of concept for encapsulating cubes engine and first person character control inside an appState. Failed to refactor map load/save from mapDevToolTest, will seek another way to structure terrain data into external file format.

mapDevAppState_2 is a second generation concept, showing basic use of spawn-point and zone area implementations. A packaged zip file (DoomVox_0_2_1.zip) shows off an executable java demo.
